# Position Based Dynamics with Unity GPU
This project implemented "Position Based Dynamics" using Unity Compute Shader.
It shows faster calculation speed when only CPU operation is used.

- Changing the xSize and ySize of the Cloth Inspector changes the number of nodes.
- Changing the width and height of the Cloth Inspector changes the size of the cloth.
- Changing the stiffness and damp values in the Cloth Inspector changes the deformation strength of the cloth.

## Environement
- Unity 2019.4.1f1
- C#
- Compute Shader
